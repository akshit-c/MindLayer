## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v20.19.0 or higher)
- **Python** (3.12 or higher)
- **Git**

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mindlayer.git
cd mindlayer
```

2. **Set up the Backend:**

   Navigate to the backend directory and create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv env
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source env/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows:
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart sentence-transformers pdfplumber python-docx numpy python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Set up the Frontend:**

   Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend Server:**

   From the `backend` directory (with virtual environment activated):
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   
   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Start the Frontend Development Server:**

   From the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Access the Application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to use the MindLayer application.

### API Endpoints

The backend provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /` - Health check
- `POST /upload/` - Upload and process documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- `POST /search/` - Search through uploaded documents
- `GET /query/` - Query the memory system

### File Upload Support

MindLayer currently supports the following file formats:
- **PDF** (.pdf) - Extracts text from PDF documents
- **DOCX** (.docx) - Extracts text from Word documents  
- **TXT** (.txt) - Plain text files

### Development

#### Backend Development
- The backend uses FastAPI for the REST API
- Document processing is handled by `services/parser.py`
- Semantic search is implemented in `services/embedder.py`
- All routes are organized in the `routers/` directory

#### Frontend Development
- Built with React 19 and Vite
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Components are in the `src/components/` directory

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory if needed:
```env
# Add any environment variables here
# For example, API keys or configuration settings
```
